Patrick taran for the arm of Springfield I will cancel as present to my right descending order is a Glenn fuel Andy Kaczynski Mark Miller and Melinda Warren if I can get a adoption of the agenda there and move on a second or please Melinda and Glenn in auditions council at all I see if I can get a mover or those in support of the adoption of the agenda got to be unanimous and is there for past we'll get into 4.1 that's adoption of the 2025 financial plan can I get a mover in a second or for that as well please Melinda and Patrick beer is all that council of the arm is Springfield adopt the 2025 financial plan consisting of one and operating budget to a capital budget three and estimate of operating Revenue and expenditures for the following fiscal year and for a 5-year capital expenditure programs Council Miller weekend just a couple of comments and questions first one to the CEO or CFO under section 3.304 subsection 1 no later than may 15th of each year this is the municipal act after adopting its operating budget for the Euro council rate of taxation so I assume that in the next coming meetings we're going to have a by-law to adopt the financial plan financial plan by resolution and then that becomes schedule a to the bylaw for the taxation a few concerns I have I wanted to share with council with this particular proposed 2025 financial plan I noted at least one Resident got back to me actually there is a couple of them a few that had input questions to our council but as you know we don't have question period we don't have delegations and we really have no mechanism for the public to engage with us but this one individual as you know it's in a agenda kind of hidden from the public but this one individual did submit comments to the CEO and Express that those comments be how can I say publicly known so I'm just wondering when people submit comments because again we've eliminated question period we don't really have delegations to this special meeting so there's no opportunity for the public to engage with us at all but yet this individual took the effort to do I think it two or three page exposition or series of questions for the financial plan but yet when they submitted them online this individual had the understanding that they would be posted publicly for people to share his concerns or maybe even respond to them but I think you know who I'm referring to I'm not sure if that individual wants me to to say that their name but I just wondering when people submit comments wasn't that supposed to be the mechanism where the public still has the opportunity to publicly have their concerns shared with the community in other words are we just now relying on oakbank rant and rave
